## A little sample of the projects I got to do while learning and searching for a job ðŸ˜Š

**1) Smart Traffic Light Project**

It is my final project as part of my studies in AI.

We worked in a CoLab environment. We used an AI technology that tracks cars and allows for an analysis and comparison of four different junctions at high and low traffic timeframes. 

We designed an ID for each car detected, allowing us to measure dwell times bycounting the frames in which the vehicle appeared. 

Lastly, we analyzed the data and reached conclusions
This project was written in Python and used Pandas, Numpy,Seaborn, OpenCV, Matplotlib and more. Here I only bring the data analysis part, for the whole project see my other repositories

**2) Food Sales**

This is a Tableau Workbook that analyzes the sales in a food factory in the United States which sells 9 different products divided into 3 categories in 4 different cities

The Dashboard of this workbook can be found at my Tableau profile at https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/deborah.kaminer
