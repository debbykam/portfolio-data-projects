# Portfolio-data-projects

## A little sample of the projects I got to do while learning and searching for a job ðŸ˜Š

**1) BI Final Project**

This is my final project as part of my studies in the BI Developer Bootcamp of Experis Academy

I used ETL processes using SSIS for manipulating data and creating a DWH of plants sales

PowerBI was then used to create interactive dashboards to present an in-depth analysis of revenues and expenses over time, segmented by US states, customers, and product categories.
There is also analysis of the TOP products, agents and customers segmented by the time measure, and presentation of the KPI's of the company.

I uploaded the Design Document and the pbix file into this repository.


**2) Food Sales**

This is a Tableau Workbook that analyzes the sales in a food factory in the United States which sells nine distinct products divided into three categories in four different cities

The Dashboard of this workbook can be founded at my Tableau profile at https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/deborah.kaminer


**3) Smart Traffic Light Project**

It is my final project as part of my studies in AI.

We worked in a CoLab environment. We used an AI technology that tracks cars and allows for an analysis and comparison of four different junctions at high and low traffic timeframes. 

We designed an ID for each car detected, allowing us to measure dwell times by counting the frames in which the vehicle appeared. 

Lastly, we analyzed the data and reached conclusions
This project was written in Python and used Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn, OpenCV, Matplotlib and more. Here I only bring the data analysis part, for the whole project see my other repositories
